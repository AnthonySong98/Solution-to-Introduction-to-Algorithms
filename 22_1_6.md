1. **problem**:

Most graph algorithms that take an adjacency-matrix representation as input require time O(V^2), but there are some exceptions.
Show how to determine whether a directed graph G contains a universal sink, i.e., a vertex with in-degree n − 1 and out-degree 0, 
in time O(V) given an adjacency matrix for G.

2. **solution**:

Suppose you have matrix A, the adjacency matrix of the graph, where A(i, j)
is 1 if and only if i has a directed edge to j. If a vertex v is a universal sink in
the graph, all the other vertices have an edge to it and it has no edges to other
vertices. This means the row corresponding to vertex v is all 0 in matrix A, and
the column corresponding to vertex v in matrix A is all 1 except for A(v, v).
Needless to say, there is at most one universal sink in the graph.
Now suppose we are looking at cell A(i, j) for i 6= j. If A(i, j) = 0, it means
vertex i does not have an edge to vertex j. This means vertex j cannot be a
universal sink. On the other hand, if A(i, j) = 1, it means vertex i has an edge
to vertex j, and thus vertex i cannot be a universal sink. Therefore, by looking
at each cell of the matrix, you can remove one vertex from the set of potential
universal sinks.
The algorithm for finding the universal sink of the graph is as follows. Start with
all vertices in the set of potential universal sinks S. Each time pick two different
vertices x and y from this set and look at the cell A(x, y). If A(x, y) is 1, remove
x from S, and otherwise remove y from S. Therefore, in n − 1 steps, and by
looking at one cell of the matrix at each step, you can removed n − 1 vertices
from S and you only have one potential universal sink say vertex u. Check the
whole column and row corresponding to vertex u in matrix A and declare u as a
universal sink if the whole row is zero and the whole column is one. Otherwise,
the graph does not have a universal sink. In this Algorithm, we check n − 1
cells of the matrix to end up with one vertex and then we check the whole row
and column corresponding to that vertex for a total of (n − 1) + (2n − 1) cells.
Hence, the algorithm has O(n) running time.

3. **implement**:

If vertex i is a universal sink according to the definition, the i-th row of the adjacency-matrix will be all “0”, and the i-th column will be all “1” except the aii entry, and clearly there is only one such vertex. We then describe an algorithm to find out if a universal sink really exist.
Starts from a11. If current entry aij = 0 then j = j + 1 (take one step right); if aij = 1 then i = i +1 (take one step down). In this way, it will stop at an entry akn of the last row or ank of the last column (n = |V|, 1 ≦ k ≦|V|). Check if vertex k satisfies the definition of universal sink (check for kth row to contain V zeros and kth column to contain k-1 1s, because the column in adajacency matrix defines in degree of a vertex), if yes then we found it, if no then there is no universal sink. Since we always make a step right or down, and checking if a vertex is a universal sink can be done in O(V), the total running time is O(V).
If there is no universal sink, this algorithm won’t return any vertex. If there is a universal sink u, the path starts from a11 will definitely meet u-th column or u-th row at some entry. Once it’s on track, it can’t get out of the track and will finally stop at the right entry.
