We have two cases, one for the diagonal entries and one for the non-diagonal entries.

The entry of [i, i] for some i represents the sum of the in and ourt degrees of the vertex that i corresponds to. To see this, we recall that an entry in a matrix product is the dot product of row i in B and column i in B T . But, column i in B T is the same as row i in B. So, we have that the entry is just row i of B dotted with itself, that is

However, since b ij only takes values in {−1, 0, 1}, we have that b 2 only takes
 ij
values in {0, 1}, taking zero iﬀ b i,j is zero. So, the entry is the sum of all nonzero entries in row i of B, Since each edge leaving i is −1 and each edge going to i is 1, we are counting all the edges that either leave or enter i, as we wanted to show.

Now, suppose that our entry is indexed by [i, j] where i =6 j. This is the dot product of row i in B with column j in B T , which is row j in B. So, the entry is equal to

Each term in this sum is −1 if k goes between i and j, or 0 if it doesn’t. Since we can’t have that two diﬀerent vertices ar both on the same side of an edge,
no terms may ever be 1. So, the entry is just -1 if there is an edge between i and j, and zero otherwise.
